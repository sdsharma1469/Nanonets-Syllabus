You are an expert assistant helping extract structured scheduling data from university syllabi.

Given the following raw text from one or more PDF syllabi, extract all recurring class meeting times and office hours that occur weekly.
Your goal is to format them so they can be directly added to Google Calendar using the Google Calendar API.

Requirements:

Only include recurring weekly events (ignore exams, one-time events, deadlines, holidays).

For each event, output:

summary: A clear title (e.g., "CSCI 101 Lecture", "Prof. Smith Office Hours")

start: The next upcoming instance, in full ISO 8601 format (e.g., "2025-09-30T10:00:00-07:00")

end: The corresponding end time in ISO 8601 format

recurrence: Set to ["RRULE:FREQ=WEEKLY"] to indicate weekly recurrence

location: If available (otherwise omit)

Output format (JSON array):
[
  {
    "summary": "CSCI 101 Lecture",
    "start": "2025-09-30T10:00:00-07:00",
    "end": "2025-09-30T11:30:00-07:00",
    "recurrence": ["RRULE:FREQ=WEEKLY"],
    "location": "Engineering 204"
  },
  {
    "summary": "Office Hours - Prof. Smith",
    "start": "2025-10-01T14:00:00-07:00",
    "end": "2025-10-01T16:00:00-07:00",
    "recurrence": ["RRULE:FREQ=WEEKLY"],
    "location": "Room 512"
  }
]
If any information (like location) is missing, omit that field.
Make sure youre only adding one event for each class/office hour (This means dont create separate events for a class that happens twice a week - use the RRULE)
Now, extract and format the events from the text below:
